## Specialization Overview
The Applied Data Science Specialization is a 5-course series offered by IBM on Coursera, designed for data science enthusiasts to gain practical experience with real-world data. Throughout the courses, I learned essential skills such as Python programming, data wrangling, data visualization, and predictive modeling, working on real-world data problems. Below, I present a detailed breakdown of the courses and key projects from the specialization.

### Want to know if this Specialization is right for you?

This action-packed Specialization is for data science enthusiasts who want to acquire practical skills for real world data problems. If you’re interested in pursuing a career in data science, and already have foundational skills or have completed the 
Introduction to Data Science Specialization
, this program is for you!  

This 4-course Specialization will give you the tools you need to analyze data and make data driven business decisions leveraging computer science and statistical analysis. You will learn Python–no prior programming knowledge necessary–and discover methods of data analysis and data visualization. You’ll utilize tools used by real data scientists like Numpy and Pandas, practice predictive modeling and model selection, and learn how to tell a compelling story with data to drive decision making.

Through guided lectures, labs, and projects in the IBM Cloud, you’ll get hands-on experience tackling interesting data problems from start to finish. Take this Specialization to solidify your Python and data science skills before diving deeper into big data, AI, and deep learning.

However, this course may not be ideal if:
- You are already an advanced data scientist looking for more specialized or niche topics.
- You are seeking highly advanced techniques and algorithms beyond an introductory level.
